# ðŸ§ª Agent-Based Epidemic Simulation (SIR Model)

This project simulates the spread of an epidemic using an agent-based model built with object-oriented programming in C++. The simulation incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics to represent geographic interactions between individuals and the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease based on the SIR (Susceptibleâ€“Infectedâ€“Recovered) model.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To build a tool that helps explore and visualize how an epidemic spreads through a population, and how different parameters or control strategies (e.g., infection rate, recovery rate, isolation measures) affect the outcome of the epidemic.

## ðŸ§° Features

- **Agent-based modeling**: Each individual is represented as an autonomous agent with their own health state and position.
- **SIR framework**: Tracks the status of individuals as Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered.
- **Spatial dynamics**: Interactions are limited by geographic proximity between agents.
- **Temporal evolution**: The simulation updates over time steps, modeling infection and recovery processes.


This projects was design in the course -Computational tools- at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. The project was written in Spanish.
