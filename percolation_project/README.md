# 🌐 2D Site Percolation Simulation

This project simulates **site percolation** on a two-dimensional lattice, developed as part of coursework at the **Department of Physics, Universidad Nacional de Colombia**. The model aims to explore the emergence of connected clusters in disordered media — a concept central to understanding the flow of fluids through porous materials, the spread of diseases, and other physical phenomena.

## 🧪 Project Description

The simulation investigates the probability of forming a **percolating cluster** in a randomly filled lattice, where each site is occupied with probability `p` and empty otherwise. If enough neighboring sites are occupied, clusters begin to form — and at a critical threshold `p_c`, a spanning (percolating) cluster emerges.

The project focuses on:

- Simulating random filling of a 2D grid
- Identifying connected clusters
- Calculating the probability `P(p, L)` that a percolating cluster exists as a function of:
  - Site occupation probability `p`
  - Lattice size `L`
- Measuring the average size of the largest cluster

## 📊 Goals

- Visualize cluster formation on 2D grids of various sizes
- Estimate the **critical percolation threshold** `p_c`
- Study finite-size effects on the percolation probability and cluster sizes
